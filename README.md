# Big Ideas Final Project - Team NAB
---
This is the repository for the final project in Professor Arjun Chandrasekhar's CMPINF 0010 course. We are tasked with finding the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh based on datasets from the WPRDC database, and using the Pandas data visualization library of the Python language to communicate our results.

## Nikhil Roy, Ayaan Siddiqui, Brayden Yan

For our project, we picked three factors that we thought were most important for the determination of a good neighborhood. The Pittsburgh SNAP Census datasets (2010) had all the information we needed, indexed by neighborhood. The factors we chose were natural environmental conditions, health/safety, and housing.
